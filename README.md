# AsciiVideo
A python program that turns your webcam clip into ascii images.

The program runs in your command window. 
First, make sure you have the requirements installed, run the program and then record a video of yourself and press q to stop it.
After that the same video will be played in your cmd window replacing every pixel with an ascii character.
